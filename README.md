# Desktop Application: Wellness Management System – Milestone 2

## Project Overview 📋
 A desk-top application built using Java Swing for the GUI and JavaDB (Derby) for persistent data storage. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and adheres to OOP principles.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java (Core + Swing)
- JavaDB (Derby) embedded mode
- NetBeans IDE (recommended)
- MVC Design Pattern
 
## 💡Core Functionality
1. Object-Oriented Design (OOP): Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction used throughout the codebase.
2. Java Swing GUI: Tabbed Navigation or Menu-based Interface to access:
- 🗓 Appointment Management
- 👨‍⚕️ Counselor Management
- 💬 Feedback Management
3. Database Integration with JavaDB (Derby) Tables:
- Appointments (student, counselor, date, time, status)
- Counselors (name, specialization, availability)
- Feedback (student, rating, comments)
 
## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
2. Open with NetBeans or IntelliJ

4. Run the Main App class (usually Main.java or App.java)
